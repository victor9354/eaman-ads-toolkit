This project building a personal automation toolkit 
for Google Ads campaign management and API learning purposes. 

SPECIFIC INTENDED USES:

1. AUTOMATION RULES ENGINE: Developing Python-based scripts to automatically 
   pause low-performing ads (CPA > $50) and increase bids for high-converting 
   keywords in my personal test campaigns.

2. DASHBOARD VISUALIZATION: Building a local web dashboard to visualize daily 
   spend, impressions, and conversion trends across my own Google Ads accounts, 
   replacing manual spreadsheet tracking.

3. ALERT SYSTEM: Creating webhook notifications (Discord/Email) for budget caps 
   and performance anomalies when managing my personal portfolio of test campaigns.

4. SEARCH TERM MINING: Developing tools to programmatically extract and analyze 
   search query reports to build negative keyword lists for my own small-scale 
   e-commerce campaigns.

5. API LEARNING & EXPERIMENTATION: Using the API to understand Google Ads 
   platform capabilities, with potential to open-source non-sensitive utility 
   scripts for the developer community.

SCOPE & COMPLIANCE:
- This is a SOLO DEVELOPER project for personal use only
- Access limited to my own Google Ads accounts (no third-party/client data)
- All development follows Google Ads API Terms of Service and Best Practices
- Educational purpose: learning programmatic PPC management techniques
- No commercial application or data resale

I maintain full control of the codebase on my local environment with no 
external user access. The tool helps me improve my own campaign ROAS while 
enhancing my backend development skills.
